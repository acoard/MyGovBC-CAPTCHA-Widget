# MyGovBC-Captcha-Widget-Client-Example

## Configuration
Edit data.service.ts to suit your needs.  Change endpoints from localhost:3000 to where you want this client code to communicate with.  Also if you want, change the nonce from a hardcoded value to a different or autogenerated one.

## Start your microservice
Make sure that you already have the microservice running on your local machine.  Run `npm start` in a separate terminal in the parent directory.

## Running the client code
Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a server.  Once that is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
